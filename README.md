## üöÄ Overview
- We introduce **VRAG**, a purely visual RAG agent that enables VLMs to progressively gather information from a coarse-grained to a fine-grained perspective.
- We propose **VRAG-RL**, a novel reinforcement learning framework tailored for training VLMs to effectively reason, retrieve, and understand visually rich information.
- We have released the **training framework** of VRAG-RL, a novel multi-turn and multimodal training framework with strong extensibility, capable of supporting training with various tools.


## üîç Quick Start

**Please refer to `run_demo.sh` to quickly start the demo.** Below is a step-by-step guide to help you run the demo on our example data:

### Dependencies
```bash
# Create environment
conda create -n vrag python=3.10
# Clone project
git clone https://github.com/alibaba-nlp/VRAG.git
cd VRAG
# Install requirements for demo only
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run VRAG Demo

First, you need to launch the search engine, which utilizes the Colpali embedding model family. It is preferable to deploy the search engine independently on a single GPU.
```bash
## Deploy search engine server
python search_engine/search_engine_api.py
```
Then download the model and deploy the server using vllm. For a 7B model, it can be deployed on a single A100 80G GPU.
```bash
vllm serve autumncc/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-VRAG --port 8001 --host 0.0.0.0 --limit-mm-per-prompt image=10 --served-model-name Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct
```
Finally, use Streamlit to launch the demo.
```bash
streamlit run demo/app.py
```

## üíª Build Your Own VRAG
Below is a step-by-step guide to help you run the VRAG on your own corpus, the entire process is divided into three steps: 
- The 1st and 2nd step are aimed at building your own purely vision-based search engine, 
- The 3rd step, similar to the quick start, is to launch the demo.

You should first convert your document to `.jpg` and store it in the `search_engine/corpus/img` with script `search_engine/corpus/pdf2images.py`. 

### Step1. Build the Index Database
Our framework is built on the foundation of the Llama-Index. We preprocess the corpus in advance and then establish an index database. 

Before embedding the whole dataset, you can run `./search_engine/vl_embedding.py` to check whether the embedding model is loaded correctly:
```python
# Test embedding model
python ./search_engine/vl_embedding.py
```
Then, you can run `ingestion.py` to embedding the whole dataset:
```python
# Document ingestion and Multi-Modal Embedding
python ./search_engine/ingestion.py
```

### Step2. Run Multi-Modal Retriever
Try using the search engine in `./search_engine/search_engine.py`:
```python
# initial engine
search_engine = SearchEngine(dataset_dir='search_engine/corpus', node_dir_prefix='colqwen_ingestion',embed_model_name='vidore/colqwen2-v1.0')
# Retrieve some results
recall_results = search_engine.batch_search(['some query A', 'some query B'])
```
Once the corpus and models for the search engine is prepared, you can directly run the search engine API server:
```bash
# run search engine server with fastapi
python search_engine/search_engine_api.py
```

### Step3. Run VRAG
Just like in the quick start guide, you can run the demo after deploying the VLM service:
```bash
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct --port 8001 --host 0.0.0.0 --limit-mm-per-prompt image=10 --served-model-name Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct
```
Use Streamlit to launch the demo.
```bash
streamlit run demo/app.py
```
Optionly, You can directly use our script for generation in `demo/vrag_agent.py` or you can integrate it into your own framework:
```python
from vrag_agent import VRAG
vrag = VRAG(base_url='http://0.0.0.0:8001/v1', search_url='http://0.0.0.0:8002/search', generator=False)
answer = vrag.run('What is the capital of France?')
```
